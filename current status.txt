Fixed;
- Bold text markdown
- Remove tailing gap
- Regular chat when no file is attached

Reset button's current behaviour;
- For normal chat, reset button reinitializes the LLM and new chat works fine
- For RAG chat(file attached), reset button does the same but after that new chat doesn't work,
further re-clicking of the reset button crashes the app
